            <h3>static</h3>
            <p class="para">HTML elements are positioned static by default.

                Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.

                An element with <b style="color: #0096c7;"> position: static;</b> is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned
                according to the normal flow of the page:
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>relative</h3>
            <p class="para">An element with <b style="color: #0096c7;"> position: relative;</b> is positioned relative to its normal position.

                Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to
                be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left
                by the element.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>fixed</h3>
            <p class="para">An element with <b style="color: #0096c7;"> position: fixed;</b> is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it
                always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties
                are used to position the element.

                A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>absolute</h3>
            <p class="para">An element with <b style="color: #0096c7;"> position: absolute;</b> is positioned relative to the nearest positioned
                ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).

                However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and
                moves along with page scrolling.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>sticky</h3>
            <p class="para">An element with <b style="color: #0096c7;"> position: sticky;</b> is positioned based on the user's scroll position.

                A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned
                relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like
                position:fixed).</p>
